Content-Based Discovery at /catalogs Level
------------

At the catalog level, answers are derived from summary metadata about the entities listed within a resource (typically a catalog or a resource that contains multiple sub-resources). Queries at this level are based on the EJP RD metadata schema adapted to certain specific filters. The following table shows an overview of the filters used at the catalog level, as defined in the EJP RD VP API Specification [`link <https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/vp-api-specs>`_]. This endpoint is most suitable for the querying of catalogs (i.e., resources that are lists of other resources).

The filters shown in the table below can be applied to a query to only show certain results.
