Content-Based Discovery at /individuals Level
------------

The record level allows querying based on safe versions of individual records within the resource's data. Record level querying takes resource discovery to a new level, allowing researchers to extract valuable insights from resources without compromising data privacy. Indeed, with this capability in place a resource can independently extend the scope and power of their discovery services to enable private networks, specialised permissions for users, and even full record discovery in other projects should they wish to do so. In the EJP RD setting, we only query content as per the EJP RD Beacon v2 API specification. This content is based on the recommended CDEs and discussions with several rare disease partners. The following table shows an overview of the filters used at the record level, as defined in the EJP RD VP API Specification [`link <https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/vp-api-specs>`_]. This endpoint is most suitable for querying individual registries, biobanks and knowledge bases (i.e., resources with data about entities such as patients, biosamples, cell lines, etc).

The filters shown in the table below can be applied to a query to only show certain results.
